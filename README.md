# Pixtar

A new Flutter application.

## Getting Started

design2 App or should I call **Pixstar** which was the name I was supposed to give it in the beginning but I gave the initial name as design2 as I ought to make some more commits to add some more features into the app including Undo Redo Options. <br>

I have developed a flutter application with the following specification:
 - The main screen has a list view containing all the saved drawings.
 - I have a search bar at the top, it filters the list. The search bar is a little bit buggy at this time, It would filter the list correctly but one should close the keyboard in order to avoid unrequired render overflow issues(on small devices), which I'll try to resolve soon.
 - You can add a new drawing or delete any previous drawing (swiping to remove items). Renaming drawing feature is coming soon!
 - The drawing is locally saved inside images in files, however it is not visible if we open the same list item again, the list items are saved however using shared Preferences.

For each drawing when opened
 - It has a drawing screen to draw/ take signatures (similar to what many delivery companies have).
 - It has options to clear the screen, save the drawing(in the files section as discussed before), however the drawing is not visible if you open the listitem again, a feature which I'll add soon.

## A very simple Demo of App
